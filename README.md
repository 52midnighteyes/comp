# <<<<< Build Status >>>>>>>

After I removed the slug, `npm run build` works locally.  
But deployment on Vercel still fails.

Blog creation can hit the API successfully, but it's not showing on the homepage yet because role-based access is not implemented.  
Login, register, and protected routes are also not implemented.

The API is still running locally using Supabase and hasn't been deployed yet.
